# Development Commands

Install locally:
```bash
make install
make activate
make run
```

Run the CLI during development:
```bash
uv python -m gh_pr_rev_md.cli <pr_url>
```

Authentication:
- XDG config under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh-pr-rev-md/config.yaml`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var
- Or pass `--token` on the CLI (not recomended)
- You can also run with no token but likely quickly rate limited (and we warn on that)

Lint and tests:
```bash
uvx ruff check --fix .
uv run -q -m pytest -n auto
uv run -q -m pytest -n auto --cov=gh_pr_rev_md --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term
```

> We always run ruff for linting and pytests for unit tests before we push up to the git remote. If it fails, we should try to fix but we can force if needed.

Docs (Sphinx):
```bash
make docs        # build to docs/_build/html
make docs-serve  # serve locally
make docs-clean  # clean outputs
```
